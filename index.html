                        <a class="text-paragraph">This app takes heavy inspiration from the very popular app MacTracker. “A Tesla version of this would be awesome”, we said.

                        <a class="text-paragraph">This was my first attempt at making a standalone WatchOS app with the new way of not requiring the Watch app to be thethered to an iOS app. You don’t see many games on Apple Watch, mainly because theres not much you can do with the small form factor, but I thought the 2048 concept would work perfectly for it.</a>

                        <a class="text-paragraph">This idea came directly from myself using the Windows app ‘Sticky Notes’, and wanting the same thing on Mac. Notes are easily identified with their unique colors, and windows maintain their position and size on the desktop before and after application restarts.</a>
                        <a class="text-paragraph">I really loved the look and functionality of Sticky Notes, and I thought its seperate and distinct colors design and overall simplicity would transfer over perfectly to macOS. Also, the idea of having an exact macOS clone of Sticky Notes and using both was very cool.</a>

                        <a class="text-paragraph">In the vein of some my other projects, this was my first, and so far, only attempt at creating a game in the Unity engine. But, I do intend on working on this again, because C# and Unity were very enjoyable.</a>
                        <a class="text-paragraph">For this to be a proper 'aim game', it needed a few primary features if nothing else, which I believe I implemented fairly well. Various different game modes to choose from, general color customization to get the best feel for targets and the environment, and the abilty to create almost infinite crosshairs to use and share.</a>
                        <a class="text-paragraph">I think the overall design of the UI worked, but I also think I could have tried a little bit harder on the environment, and to make it feel more like a 'game' rather than just a 'program'.</a>

                        <a class="text-paragraph">This app leverages Twitch’s API and the IRC protocol they still use for chats, and uses multiple other APIs (Google, Microsoft, NLP) for translating incoming messages from one language to another. Say Finnish -> English, or vice versa, which is what I mainly use it for.</a>

                        <a class="text-paragraph">Github Desktop just didn’t have enough options for light and dark mode themes. Dark mode is the blue-ish ‘Monokai’ sort of dark, which I personally don’t like, and the light mode just doesn’t go far enough. I personally love when software or websites have multiple theme options for someone like me who likes things a bit different.</a>

                        <a class="text-paragraph">Basically, the approach was “what’s the quickest and simplest way of writing games to play in a terminal?”. I love these games, and all of them work perfectly for the simple ASCII character way of rendering games in the terminal. So I started with the easiest one first (Connect Four), and worked my way up to Go.</a>
                        <a class="text-paragraph">Also, with all of them being in Python and written in such a simple way, my intention was to work on some Tensorflow/PyTorch machine learning and implement it into some or all of the games. This will probably be the final stage of the project.</a>
