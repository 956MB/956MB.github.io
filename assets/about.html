                        <a class="text-paragraph">Hi, my name is <me>Alexander Bays</me>, and I’m a self taught programmer and part time graphic designer from <dallas>Dallas, TX</dallas>.</a>
                        <a class="text-paragraph">I mainly focus on frontend design and functionality for both desktop and mobile software. I’ve created applications for Windows, macOS, iPhone, and Apple Watch. I would say my preference leans towards the Apple side, but I have no problem working on anything else inside of the frameworks and languages I have come to learn.</a>
                        <a class="text-paragraph">Aside from learning
                                <swift>Swift</swift> (and of course
                                <swiftui>SwiftUI</swiftui>) early on to try my hand at Apple applications, I’ve implemented languages like
                                <cpp>C++</cpp> using the
                                <qt>Qt</qt> library, which I REALLY love for desktop software,
                                <js>JavaScript</js>/
                                <htm>HTML</htm>/
                                <css>CSS</css> inside of the
                                <electron>Electron</electron> framework, also Windows desktop, minor
                                <csharp>C#</csharp> for some
                                <unity>Unity</unity> game programming, and
                                <python>Python</python> for general scripting purposes and coding problems. Learning newer languages like Go and Kotlin however are still goals as well.</a>

                        <a class="text-paragraph">I started my self taught skills journey around 2010, teaching myself Photoshop and trying to be a graphic designer, but a little over 4 years ago (2018), I discovered programming through a computer engineer friend, and this of course became what I wanted to do. It took a while of me unsure whether I’d go on and want to work backend, cyber security, machine learning... but I eventually I realized I was being pulled toward the design side of programming. Still wanting to become a talented programmer and build sofisticated software, but also using my design insticts to make what I work on look cool as well.</a>
                        <a class="text-paragraph">These days, my real focus is getting better at writing more complex and effiecient code, and the design stuff is more for fun on the side, but I think that helps my programming in a way as well.</a>
